The sector file is split into discrete sections for ease of maintenance.  These txt files are numbered to allow for programmatic assembly.  Do not change the ## prefixes!

Reassembling the whole thing is accomplished by command line.  Navigate to the folder (use the cd command) and then use this string to combine all .txt files into an example.sct2

copy *.txt example.sct2
